# NaiveBayesClassified
Applied Naive Bayes classification on open source datasets

- All the datasets are in their respective folders.
- Each dataset has its script which performs Naïve Bayes classification.
- If separate training and testing data is not available, the codes perform Leave-One-Out cross validation.
- Each dataset code creates a **result** file which stores the accuracy.
- The file **combine.py** in the main folder compiles all the results and stores them in the excel file **Final Results.xlsx**.
- Since **MONK’s Problems** dataset has multiple training and testing files, classification has been performed individually and for the combined data too.
